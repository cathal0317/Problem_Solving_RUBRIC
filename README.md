### Entry
- **Problem data and assumptions**: Clearly states the given information and assumptions of the problem (what I know), or explicitly specifies reasonable assumptions when they are not provided.
- **Goal / unknown**: Clearly states the unknown of the problem and/or sets out precise goals for the investigation (what I want).
- **Notation and representations**: Introduces appropriate notation, representations, or diagrams when applicable.
- **Specialisation**: Specialises to simple or illustrative cases, when appropriate, to gain insight into the problem and identify potential patterns.
- **Interim structure**: Attempts to find interim results and useful structure within the problem.
- **Conjectures**: Draws conjectures based on special cases and/or interim results.

### Attack
- **Justification or refutation of conjectures**: Attempts to justify conjectures with reasoning or disprove them (e.g. by finding counterexamples).
- **Dealing with being stuck**: Clearly articulates when and why they are stuck, and shows evidence of strategies used to move forward.
- **Alternative approaches**: When possible, explores alternative lines of thought or reasoning, either to verify work or to progress when stuck.

### Solution
- **Clarity of results**: Formulates clear claims, conjectures, and main results.
- **Rigour**: Provides proofs or convincing arguments for claims or conjectures, with rigorous and coherent reasoning.
- **Use of computation/visualisation**: Uses Python plots, graphs, or calculations where appropriate to demonstrate, check, or support results.
- **Checking**: Critically checks and rethinks results, arguments, and conclusions, as well as their implications where possible.

### Review
- **Reflection**: Reflects on key moments in the process, such as mistakes, breakthroughs, or crucial insights, and what was learned from them.
- **Extensions and generalisations**: Suggests possible generalisations or extensions of the problem and briefly discusses, for example, critical differences, possible approaches, and potential obstacles.
- **Structure**: Presents an organised and coherent structure of sections, subsections, and arguments.

### Overall
- **Presentation**: Ensures clear presentation, with transparent statements of main results and relationships.
- **Use of figures and tables**: Provides explicit descriptions and explanations of any plots, tables, or diagrams used.
- **Mathematical clarity**: Maintains mathematical clarity and logical flow throughout.
- **Logical order**: Follows a logical order of presentation and approach, making the reasoning easy to follow.
